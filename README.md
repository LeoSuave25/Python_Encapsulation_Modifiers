# 🚀 Main Interface 🚀

This project provides a main interface to access and interact with different programs. The programs include a Car program, a Pet program, and a Fan program. Each program is located in its own subdirectory and has its own main script.

## 📚 How to Use 📚

When you run the main script, you will be asked which program you want to access. You can enter 'Car', 'Pet', 'Fan', or 'quit'.

- If you enter 'Car', the main script of the Car program will be run.
- If you enter 'Pet', the main script of the Pet program will be run.
- If you enter 'Fan', the main script of the Fan program will be run.
- If you enter 'quit', the main interface will exit.

Each program has its own set of interactions. For example, in the Car program, you can accelerate, brake, or get the current speed of the car. In the Pet program, you can enter your pet's information and choose whether to display it. In the Fan program, you can interact with different attributes of a fan.

## 🚗 Car Program 🚗

In the Car program, you can interact with a car. You can accelerate, brake, or get the current speed of the car. The car's speed will increase or decrease by 5 km/h each time you accelerate or brake.

## 🐾 Pet Program 🐾

In the Pet program, you can enter your pet's information, including its name, type, and age. After entering your pet's information, you can choose whether to display it.

## 🌬️ Fan Program 🌬️

In the Fan program, you can interact with different attributes of a fan, including its speed, power, radius, and color. You can get or set these attributes.

## 🔄 Retry Function 🔄

After interacting with a program, you can choose whether to enter another set of information for that program. If you choose to do so, the program will prompt you for the information again.
